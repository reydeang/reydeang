- 👋 Hi, I’m @reydeang, a 72-year old senior, from the Philippines.
- 👀 I’m interested in App Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python.
- 💞️ As an absolute beginner, I’m not yet into collaboration. 
- 📫 How to reach me. My email address is reydeang@gmail.com
- I want to use Github to help me track and understand the changes being made to Apps 
  that are used as teaching tools in the Python course I am now taking 
  under Ardit Sulce at Udemy.
